## Usage

1. **Define Work Shifts**: Enter shift names (e.g., "ER Nurse I", "Handyman II, Janitor") and specify the required number of workers. for this demo, we use D00n to D4 to represent day shifts and E1 to E3 for evening shifts

2. **Add Employees** : Provide employee names, select their available working days, and assign their specializations. Some workers may have more than one specialization for example some staffs may work both day and evening shifts, a handyman may also do the gardner shift. So select shifts according to the order of preferrence as the app will take this into consideration when assigning shifts, for example, select day shifts first for users who prefer the day shift. Also select working days according to preference as some workers may prefer working on the weekends more than weekdays.
